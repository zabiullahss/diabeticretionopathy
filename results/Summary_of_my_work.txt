Implemented a deep learning system for automated detection and severity classification of diabetic retinopathy using the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset. Developed a comprehensive image preprocessing pipeline incorporating black border removal, contrast enhancement with CLAHE, and image normalization to optimize feature visibility. Addressed significant class imbalance through weighted sampling and loss function modifications. Trained an EfficientNet-B4 model using transfer learning and achieved a validation Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.8919, approaching clinical-grade performance. The system successfully classified retinal images into five severity levels (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative), potentially reducing the burden on ophthalmologists and enabling earlier intervention for patients at risk of vision loss. The project demonstrates practical application of computer vision and deep learning techniques to solve critical healthcare challenges.
